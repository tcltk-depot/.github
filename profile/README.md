# About tcltk-depot

This Github organization, owned by the Tcl Community Association, hosts repositories for Tcl/Tk packages and applications, in particular those that are no longer maintained by the original author(s). The intent is to avoid proliferation of forks by providing a centralized location for users to download as well as provide patches.

See [Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/tcltk-depot/repositories?q=visibility%3Apublic+archived%3Afalse) for a list of currently hosted packages.

## Requesting an addition

To request addition of a package, please raise a [ticket](https://github.com/tcltk-depot/.github/issues) with a public URL of the repository to be added along with contact information of the original owner/maintainer if available. Ideally, this source repository would have merged any existing patches or forks.

Note that addition of a repository here does *not* change the license or copyright of the package.

## Contributing

The tcltk-depot administrators are not responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the hosted packages. The intent is that this will be a community effort. If willing to help in this regard, either as a member with access to multiple repositories or as a collaborator with access to specific repositories, please raise a [ticket](https://github.com/tcltk-depot/.github/issues).
